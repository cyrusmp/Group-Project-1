        <h1> Facts About Climate Change </h1>

        <h2>Rising Temperatures</h2>

        <p>According to a report conducted by <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/">Nasa</a>, the planet's average surface temperatures has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, with most of the warming occuring in the past 40 years. </p>

        <h2>Impact on Wildlife</h2>

        <p>Polar bears and marine life are the most affected by climate changes because they are heavily reliant on specific habitats. The <a href="https://www.fws.gov/initiative/climate-change/impacts">U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service</a></p> agency has reported a decline in polar bear populations in Alaska and Canada as well as negative impacts on cool-water fish due to higher water temperatures.
