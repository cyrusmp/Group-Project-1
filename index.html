        <h1> Facts About Climate Change </h1>

        <h2>Fact #1: Earth's temperature has risen by about 2&#8457; since 1850 </h2>
        
        <div class="fact">
          <p>According to the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature">Science & Information For A Climate-Smart Nation</a>, the planet's average surface temperatures has risen by 0.11&#8457; per decade since 1850. <br> The graph below depicts cooler-than-average years represented in blue and warmer-than-average years represented in red. </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Fact #2: Climate change destabilizes ecosystems </h2>

        <div class="fact">
          <p>Environmental factors that are impacted by climate change include:
          <ul>
            <li>temperature</li>
            <li>precipitation patterns</li>
            <li>ocean acidity</li>
            <li>sea levels</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These shifts disrupt an ecosystems natural balance creating a domino effect of changes that can lead to the eventual collapse of an ecosystem.<br> The following photo is an example of a collapsed ecosystem, it is a comparison of the Aral Sea taken 25 years apart (in 1989 and 2014). An ecosystem collapse does not mean a complete disappearence of life from the region but rather a change in the original ecosystems characteristics. </p>

        <h2>Fact #3: Glaciers are melting at a rapid rate </h2>

        <div class="fact">
          <p>Melting glaciers in Anarctica and Greenland lead to coastal erosion and elevate storm surges. <br> The <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/why-are-glaciers-and-sea-ice-melting">World Wildlife Fund</a> states that "Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the world's remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100.", adding that the Arctic will be without ice as soon as 2040.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Fact #4: Climate change leads to more frequent weather events </h2>

        <div class="fact">
          <p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/extreme-weather/">Nasa</a> states that heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricases are becoming more frequent and intense.<br>As air and ocean temperature warms, this affects land ice, the water cycle, and shifts weather patterns making extreme weather worse.</p>

        <h2>Fact #5: At least 10,967 species face extinction</h2>

        <div class="fact">
          <p>The <a href="https://iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/species-and-climate-change#:~:text=Climate%20change%20currently%20affects%20at,the%20likelihood%20of%20their%20extinction.">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> reported that 10,967 species are already affected by climate change and risk extinction.<br>In general, up to 1 million plant and animal species will be affected if current greenhouse gas emissions continue.</p>

        <h2>Fact #6: Carbon dioxide accounts for 64% of the warming effect on the climate </h2>

        <div class="fact">
          <p>Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere <br> It is created mostly through fossil fuel combustion and the production of cement according to the <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/greenhouse-gas-concentrations-hit-record-high-again#:~:text=Carbon%20dioxide%20is%20the%20single,fuel%20combustion%20and%20cement%20production.">World Meteorological Organization.</a></p>
